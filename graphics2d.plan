2d graphics are to be implemented in a similar way to 3d graphics. Drawing simple shapes should be possible in few lines of code. These shapes should be able to be drawn about a local axis and be transformed using the Transform2D component. On windows direct2D will be used since it can directly render to a IDXGISwapChain. On Linux and OSX the best option is probably cairo, this will involve an extera copy operation (bitblit).

2D graphics will be done wtih each component having its own local transformation, and the whole shape, represented by an entity, will have a global transformation.
