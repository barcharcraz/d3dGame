d3dGame
=======

This project is a 2D and eventually 3D engine written using Direct2D/Direct3D.

Also included is a basic windowing library written with the windows API and a project that outlines the intended architecture of the engine

Composition is used to encourage code reuse among various game components and interfaces are used wherever possible to facilitate testing (like dependency injection but without a framework beyond constructors and preprocessor things).

As of now this is a side project as I am spending most of my time on RTSGame made in unity
