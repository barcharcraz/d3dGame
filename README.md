d3dGame
=======

This project is a 2D and eventually 3D engein written using Direct2D/Direct3D.

Game entites are represented in a deep class hierarchy and not by composition and multiple inheratance is used in an
effort to avoid blob/god objects.

As of now this is a side project as I am spending most of my time on RTSGame made in unity
