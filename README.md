d3dGame
=======

This project is a 2D and eventually 3D engine written using Direct2D/Direct3D.

Composition is used to encourage code reuse among various game components and interfaces are used wherever possible to facilitate testing (like dependency injection but without a framework beyond constructors and preprocessor things).

As of now this is a side project as I am spending most of my time on RTSGame made in unity
